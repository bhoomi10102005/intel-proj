optimize manufacturing processes, and ultimately save money while improving quality.

Think of it as the foundation of a house - you need a solid foundation before 
you can build anything else. Data Analysis provides that solid foundation for 
all our AI and business decisions.

This section proves that sometimes the most valuable insights come not from 
complex algorithms, but from simply asking the right questions and looking at 
data from the right angles!

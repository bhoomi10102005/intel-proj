    processed_features = preprocess_features(sensor_data)
    
    # Generate prediction
    prediction = model.predict(processed_features)
    confidence = model.predict_proba(processed_features)
    
    # Format results
    result = {
        'condition': 'worn' if prediction[0] == 1 else 'unworn',
        'confidence': max(confidence[0]) * 100,
        'risk_level': calculate_risk_level(confidence[0]),

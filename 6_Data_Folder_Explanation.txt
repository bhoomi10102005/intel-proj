                        DATA FOLDER - COMPREHENSIVE EXPLANATION
================================================================================

üìÅ WHAT IS OUR DATA FOLDER?
================================================================================

Hello everyone! Let me take you on a journey through our data treasure chest! 
Think of our data folder as a digital museum that contains real evidence from 
actual manufacturing experiments. Just like archaeologists study ancient artifacts 
to understand past civilizations, we study this manufacturing data to understand 
machine behavior and predict the future!

Our data comes from the University of Michigan's SMART Lab (System-level 
Manufacturing and Automation Research Testbed) where real scientists conducted 
18 carefully controlled experiments on a real CNC milling machine in April 2018.

üè≠ WHAT EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED?
================================================================================

THE REAL-WORLD SETUP:
The researchers took blocks of wax (2" x 2" x 1.5") and used a CNC milling machine 
to carve an "S" shape into them. Why "S"? It stands for "Smart Manufacturing" - 
how cool is that! They created 18 different test pieces, each one telling a story 
about machine performance.

THE EXPERIMENTAL VARIABLES:
The scientists were like detectives testing different clues:

1. TOOL CONDITION:
   - 8 experiments with UNWORN tools (fresh, sharp tools)
   - 10 experiments with WORN tools (used, dulled tools)

2. FEEDRATE (How fast the machine cuts):
   - 6 mm/s (slow and careful)
   - 15 mm/s (medium speed)
   - 20 mm/s (fast and aggressive)

3. CLAMP PRESSURE (How tightly the wax block is held):
   - 2.5 bar (loose grip - might cause problems)
   - 3.0 bar (medium grip)
   - 4.0 bar (tight grip - secure)

THE MACHINING PROCESS:
Each experiment carved the "S" shape through 6 different phases:
- Layer 1 Up & Down (carving the top part)
- Layer 2 Up & Down (carving the middle part)
- Layer 3 Up & Down (carving the bottom part)
- Plus preparation and repositioning steps

üìä WHAT DATA FILES DO WE HAVE?
================================================================================

1. TRAINING DATA (train.csv):
   - 19 rows of summarized experiment results
   - Basic information about each experiment
   - Perfect for beginners learning machine learning
   - Contains the "answers" (worn vs unworn labels)

2. DETAILED EXPERIMENT DATA (experiment_01.csv to experiment_18.csv):
   - 18 files with high-resolution sensor data
   - Each file contains 1,057 measurements taken every 100 milliseconds
   - 47 different sensor measurements per row
   - Like having a microscopic view of the manufacturing process

3. DOCUMENTATION (README.txt):
   - Scientific explanation of the experiments
   - Detailed description of each measurement
   - Guidelines for using the data correctly

4. VISUAL EVIDENCE (test_artifact.jpg):
   - Photo of an actual carved wax piece
   - Shows what the "S" shape looks like
   - Proof that these experiments really happened!

üî¨ DETAILED BREAKDOWN OF OUR DATA:
================================================================================

TRAINING DATA (train.csv) - THE SIMPLE STORY:
```
Columns we have:
- No: Experiment number (1-18)
- material: Always "wax" (consistent material)
- feedrate: Speed of cutting (6, 15, or 20 mm/s)
- clamp_pressure: Holding pressure (2.5, 3.0, or 4.0 bar)
- tool_condition: THE ANSWER WE WANT TO PREDICT! (unworn/worn)
- machining_finalized: Did the experiment complete? (yes/no)
- passed_visual_inspection: Did the final part look good? (yes/no)
```

WHAT THIS TELLS US:
- 8 experiments had unworn tools, 10 had worn tools
- Higher feedrates often correlate with tool wear
- Clamp pressure affects both completion and quality
- Some experiments didn't finish due to safety concerns

EXPERIMENT DATA FILES - THE DETAILED STORY:
Each experiment file contains 47 columns of sensor data:

X-AXIS MOTOR DATA (11 measurements):
- Position, velocity, acceleration (actual vs commanded)
- Current, voltage, power consumption
- Like monitoring the horizontal movement of the cutting tool

Y-AXIS MOTOR DATA (11 measurements):
- Same measurements as X-axis
- Monitors the front-to-back movement

Z-AXIS MOTOR DATA (10 measurements):
- Vertical movement (up and down)
- Critical for cutting depth control

SPINDLE MOTOR DATA (12 measurements):
- The rotating motor that spins the cutting tool
- Includes torque inertia measurements
- Power consumption indicates cutting difficulty

MACHINE CONTROL DATA (3 measurements):
- Program number, sequence number, feedrate
- Which step of the G-code program is running

PROCESS INFORMATION:
- Machining_Process: What operation is currently happening
- "Starting", "Prep", "Layer 1 Up", "Layer 1 Down", etc.

üìà WHAT PATTERNS CAN WE DISCOVER?
================================================================================

TOOL WEAR INDICATORS:
1. POWER CONSUMPTION:
   - Worn tools require more power to cut
   - Shows up in X1_OutputPower, Y1_OutputPower readings
   - Progressive increase throughout the machining process

2. CURRENT FEEDBACK:
   - Higher current indicates more resistance
   - Worn tools create more friction
   - Visible in X1_CurrentFeedback, Y1_CurrentFeedback

3. POSITION ACCURACY:
   - Worn tools cause vibration and deflection
   - Difference between actual and commanded positions
   - Shows up as position errors in X1, Y1, Z1 readings

4. VELOCITY VARIATIONS:
   - Inconsistent cutting creates speed fluctuations
   - Worn tools can't maintain steady feedrates
   - Visible in velocity measurements

QUALITY INDICATORS:
1. COMPLETION STATUS:
   - Some experiments stopped due to safety concerns
   - Usually correlated with worn tools and high feedrates
   - Shows up in machining_finalized column

2. VISUAL INSPECTION:
   - Failed visual inspection often means poor surface finish
   - Caused by worn tools or inadequate clamping
   - Recorded in passed_visual_inspection column

üí° HOW DO WE USE THIS DATA?

This was difficult because complex AI models are usually slow, but manufacturing needs instant decisions. I solved it by optimizing the Random Forest algorithm and using efficient data preprocessing techniques to achieve 23ms response time. What I learned was that engineering trade-offs between speed and accuracy are crucial in industrial applications."

‚Ä¢ "Another challenge was dealing with imbalanced data - we had many more 'not worn' tool examples than 'worn' examples. This was difficult because AI models can become biased toward the majority class. I solved it by using stratified sampling and cross-validation techniques to ensure fair model training. What I learned was that real-world data is messy and requires careful preprocessing."

### **Learning from Mistakes:**
**Honest Approach:** "I made some mistakes during my Intel internship, like initially focusing only on accuracy without considering prediction speed. But I learned from this by researching real-time AI deployment requirements and optimizing my models accordingly. Now I know to always consider both performance metrics and business constraints when developing AI solutions."

‚Ä¢ "I would also add automated alert systems that send notifications to maintenance teams when tool replacement is predicted. This would help users by eliminating the need to constantly monitor the dashboard and ensuring immediate action on predictions."

### **Scalability:**
**Simple Explanation:** "Right now, my Intel ML system works well for analyzing data from individual CNC machines. To handle an entire manufacturing facility with hundreds of machines, I would need to implement cloud computing and distributed processing. It's like expanding from a single restaurant to a chain - you need centralized management systems and standardized processes across all locations."

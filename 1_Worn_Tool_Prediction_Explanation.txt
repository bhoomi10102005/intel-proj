================================================================================

ðŸŽ¯ WHAT IS WORN TOOL PREDICTION?
================================================================================

The Worn Tool Prediction system is an advanced Machine Learning application that acts 
as an intelligent diagnostic tool for manufacturing equipment. It analyzes sensor data 
from cutting tools and predicts when they need replacement, similar to how a medical 
diagnostic system can predict health issues by analyzing symptoms.

This system now includes both real-time single-sample prediction and comprehensive 
batch processing capabilities, making it suitable for both immediate decision-making 
and large-scale manufacturing analysis.
